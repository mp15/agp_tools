for the largest scaffold in AGP 1
plot AGP 1 as SVG
locate largest matching track in AGP 2
plot AGP 2 as SVG below AGP 1
link where ID is the same

highlight default gaps in yellow
where two contigs aka a pair havethe  same ids and diff gap, allow copy of gap between tracks

highlight where a contig is present in one AGP scaffold but not scaffolded in the other AGP

consider plotting evidence track for each AGP
